## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
mental_data <- read.csv("data/wrangled_dataset.csv")

colnames(mental_data) <- c("Country", "Year", "Schizophrenia", "Bipolar Disorders",
                           "Eating Disorders", "Anxiety Disorders", "Drug Use Disorders", 
                           "Depression", "Alcohol Use Disorders")

health_new <- mental_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !c(Country, Year),
    names_to = "disorders", 
    values_to = "percentages")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
